## About

The task requires creating a React application to handle a randomly generated JSON file. This application should render the JSON data, presenting each array member as a row with property-value pairs. The application should support inline editing based on data types (e.g., text, number, email, date, boolean), and there's no need for data validation or an elaborate UI. While filtering and ordering of rows are optional, implementing them would be a plus. The project must be implemented in TypeScript using React for the front-end, and performance is crucial as the JSON file can contain unlimited data.
